We get some rules to follow<br>
That and this, these and those<br>
No one knows<br>
We get these pills to swallow<br>
How they stick in your throat?<br>
Tastes like gold<br>
Oh, what you do to me<br>
No one knows<br>
And I realize you're mine<br>
Indeed a fool am I<br>
And I realize you're mine<br>
Indeed a fool am I<br>
I journey through the desert<br>
Of the mind with no hope<br>
I follow<br>
I drift along the ocean<br>
Dead lifeboats in the sun<br>
And come undone<br>
Pleasantly caving in<br>
I come undone<br>
And I realize you're mine<br>
Indeed a fool am I<br>
And I realize you're mine<br>
Indeed a fool am I<br>
Heaven smiles above me<br>
What a gift here below<br>
But no one knows<br>
The gift that you give to me<br>
No one knows<br>
